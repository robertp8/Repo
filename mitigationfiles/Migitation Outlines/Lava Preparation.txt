?750 years is important because averaged over more years?
-Chose since 1800 because most people wont' be here for over 100 years.
-Maybe list the places hit by eruptions in last 100 years
-Lines separating zones are not thin enough. Try a location on a line separating zones.
-Slow in starting and slow in outputting the haz array
-When position outside of big island then it just outputs the last haz array values
-Theres two jqueries going on at the same time?
-Maybe put the files on the server for mitigation then upload because if all in html file then it will be slow. It's already slowing down.
-Need to figure out how get new line in the haz array
-Figure out how to account for if not in any polygon and output message "Not in any zone"
-Add general things to consider on web
-Put that disclaimer at the bottom of the page
