Elevate coastal homes. Raise furnace, water heater, and electric panel to higher floors or attic (water heater is source of water). Most tsunamis are less than 10 feet. Consult an engineer to inspect and determine ways to divert water away from the structure. Homeowner insurance doesn't cover flooding. Contact national flood insurance program. Make a list of items to bring inside to help you remember the items that can be swept away. Possibly retrofit home with bilge pump or garage door seal kit.
